//  Suppose you want to deposit a certain amount of money into a savings account and
//  then leave it alone to draw interest for the next 10 years. At the end of 10 years, you
//  would like it to have $10,000 in the account. How much do you need to deposit today to
//  make that happen? You can use the following formula, which is known as the present
//  value formula, to find out:
//
//  P = F / (1 + r)^n
//
//  The terms in the formula are as follows:
//
//  * P is the present value, or the amount that you need to deposit today
//  * F is the future value that you want in the account. (In this case, F is $10,000.)
//  * r is the annual interest rate
//  * n is the number of years that you plan to let the money sit in the account
//
//  Write a program that has a function named presentValue that performs this calculation.
//  The function should accept the future value, annual interest rate, and number of
//  years as arguments. It should return the present value, which is the amount that you
//  need to deposit today. Demonstrate the function in a program that lets the user experiment
//  with different values for the formula's terms.
